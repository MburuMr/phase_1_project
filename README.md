###Aviation Data Analysis###
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing aviation data to uncover patterns and trends that can enable the organization to know which aircrafts to invest in, in the expansion of the business into the aviation industry. By identifying key factors contributing to accidents and the risks involved, it aims to provide actionable insights that benefit the organization.

**Business Problem**
Understanding aviation accidents and the risks involved in the aviation industry, will be able to help the organizaton to know the types of aircrafts that the organization should invest in. This project addresses key questions such as: Which aircrafts should the organization invest in? How do weather conditions impact accident rates? Which aircraft models are frequently involved in incidents? How does the purpose of acquiring or travelling in an aircraft impact accident rates

These insights directly contribute to decision-making on how to expand the business into the aviation industry.

**Data Understanding**
The analysis is based on data obtained from the NTSB Aviation Dataset, which includes: Source: NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board). Key Variables: Weather conditions (IMC vs. VMC). Aircraft model. Purpose of flight(eg. personal, business etc) The dataset has been cleaned and processed  ensuring accuracy and consistency in analysis.

**Data Analysis**
The project employs the following methods: 1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data to handle missing values and ensure consistency. 2.Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing trends and patterns in accidents by purpose of flight, weather, and aircraft type. 3.Visualization: Interactive charts and dashboards created in Tableau for stakeholder accessibility.

Key findings include: IMC weather conditions lead to significantly higher accident rates. For the purpose of the flight, personal purpose is the most accident-prone. Specific aircraft models, such as Cessna, appear frequently in accident reports.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed: 
1. Aviation accidents are notably influenced by weather conditions, with clear skies (VMC) accounting for the majority due to higher flight activity, while adverse conditions (IMC) pose significant risks, underscoring the importance of robust pilot training and advanced navigation systems.
2. The organization should consider acquiring aircraft, Boeing, Grumman or Mooney, which have considerably low accidents as compared to the other types of aircraft.
3. In relation to the number of engines, the organization should acquire aircrafts that have more than six engines. In my analysis I have discovered that aircrafts with less than six engines are often involved in accidents while those with more than six engines are close to none.
4. Since the organization is cosidering to take up this venture as a business, they have an advantage because public aircrafts have considerably low accident levels as compared to the use of aircrafts for personal purposes.
5. The organization should venture into this business because over the years the number of, the number accidents has been reducing, thus injuries have been decreasing significantly while the number of uninjured people has been increasing, this is a sign that safety measures have been improving over the years and it can get better.
